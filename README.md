# German Credit Data Analysis
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of the famous [German Credit dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data)). The purpose of this analysis is to build and validate a Random Forest model in an interactive R-Markdown document *analysis.rmd*, where it is possible to interactively explore the data, and also to train and validate the model.

The end-user interactive Shiny application can be accessed [here] (https://asot.shinyapps.io/german_credit_data_analysis/).
